'''To count from one number a to another number b, inclusive, in programming, a loop structure is typically used. The specific implementation varies depending on the programming language.
General approach:
Input:
Obtain the two numbers, a and b, from the user or define them within the program.
Loop Initialization:
Start a loop, typically a for loop or a while loop, with a counter variable initialized to the value of a.
Loop Condition:
Set the loop condition to continue as long as the counter variable is less than or equal to b.
Iteration:
Inside the loop, perform the desired action (e.g., print the current value of the counter, perform a calculation).
Increment:
Increment the counter variable in each iteration to move towards b.'''
